# BPM Ideas Hub
Public repository of BPM research ideas.

## About
This is a curated repository of promising research ideas in Business Process Management. It is a platform where *early-stage researchers* can find engaging ideas to work on, *established researchers* can promote their ideas and *everyone* can find inspiration and possible collaborations.

## Terms of Use
Please keep in mind the following terms of use for the research ideas you find here.
1. **Invite** the idea contributor as co-author. Chances are good that this person can bring the required knowledge and also already have some plan, implementation experiments or other artifacts that can help your work. This primarily applies if you are writing a research paper, but keeping this person in the loop if you are working on, e.g. a Master thesis is also advisable. 
2. If the above does not apply - the contributor is not interested in co-authorship or you are just writing a seminar paper -  still mention the idea contributor in the **Acknowledgements** section of your work as it is **required by the license**.
3. **Always cite** BPM Ideas Hub in your work. As of now, it is recommended to cite it as a webpage: [https://github.com/MaxVidgof/bpm-ideas-hub](https://github.com/MaxVidgof/bpm-ideas-hub), but this is subject to change.
4. If your work gets published, please provide a reference to your work via e-mail to  [maxim.vidgof@wu.ac.at](mailto:maxim.vidgof@wu.ac.at?subject=%5BBPM%20Ideas%20Hub%20Update%5D) so that the repository can be updated.
